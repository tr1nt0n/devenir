\textbf{English horn:} Looking up from beneath the grass, you may see a songbird. It doesn't matter which kind. All you need is to see. You may be able to watch the way her neck moves. A glint of sun may fall off her feathers and into your eye. And if you don't rub the glint out, and if the grass doesn't obstruct your vision beyond what is beautiful, you may even know where she's looking just by watching her eyes. You might wonder how you know, if they're completely black eyes, and if they have no whiteness around the iris which you can track the direction of. How is it that you are so sure, \textbf{English horn, Mezzo-soprano (unison):} more sure than you were sure that you loved her, \textbf{English horn:} that you know \textit{exactly} where she's looking?

\textbf{Mezzo-soprano:} ``You have to hear it." \\ ``Yeah, it's pretty quiet, but you hear it, right?" \\ ``I don't think it's that far away." \\ ``Have you ever been in the middle of a cave and been able to hear a conversation at the mouth as if they're right next to you, because of the echo?" \\ ``It's the opposite of that, I hate it."

\textbf{English horn:} If the grass isn't so much to obstruct your view, with the sun shining on the other side of it and turning it black against the sky, you may see her head jut towards the ground. In an instant, she may rise. Her and the grass may share a silhouette in front of the white sky, and you may be able to make out a beetle in her beak. Its abdomen might be bent between her jaws, and its wings may be disfigured, and its legs may rotate in six directions, and you may not be able to understand how you feel. You probably won't understand. You won't know what she has become to you, and this will scare you. If the wings splay outward when she crushes its outer shell and swallows as quickly as she rose, you will be afraid.
