\textbf{Cassandra} ( or, \textbf{Kassandra} ) was said to be a Trojan priestess of Apollo. Loved by the god, she promised herself to him in exchange for powers of divination. Once she received the gift, she denied Apollo of her promise, enraging the god. As divine powers are irrevocable, Apollo instead afflicted Cassandra with a punitive curse: that although she would always divine accurately, her prophecies would never be believed.
