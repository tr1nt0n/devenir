Looking up from beneath the grass, you may see a songbird. It doesn't matter which kind. All you need is to see. You may be able to watch the way her neck moves. A glint of sun may fall off her feathers and get in your eye. And if you don't rub that glint out, and if the grass doesn't obstruct your vision beyond what is beautiful, you may even know where she's looking just by watching her eyes. You might wonder how you know, if they're completely black eyes, and if they have no whiteness around the iris which you can track the direction of. How is it that you are so sure, more sure than you were sure that you loved her, that you know \textit{exactly} where she's looking?

With the base of his skull and the back of his knees wrapped around either arm of the chair,

Noted the movement of the leaves,

And envied them.

He remembered the sign,

If the grass isn't so much to obstruct your view, with the sun shining on the other side of it and turning it black against the sky, you may see her head jut towards the ground. In an instant, she may rise. Her and the grass may share a silhouette in front of the white sky, and you may be able to make out a beetle in her beak. Its abdomen might be bent between her jaws, and its wings may be disfigured, and its legs may rotate in six directions, and you may not be able to understand how you feel. You probably won't understand. You won't know what she has become to you, and this will scare you. If the wings splay outward when she crushes its outer shell and swallows as quickly as she rose, you will be afraid.
